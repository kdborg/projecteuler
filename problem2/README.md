# Even Fibonacci numbers

## Description

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

## Solution 1: Brute Force

    long sum = 0;

    long a = 1, b = 1, temp;

    while (b < 4000000) {
        if (b % 2 == 0) {
            sum += b;
        }

        temp = a + b;
        a = b;
        b = temp;
    }

    cout << "Answer: " << sum << endl;
    
## Solution 2: Using Binet's formula
    
        long sum = 0;
    
        long i = 3;
        long f = fibonacci(i);
        while (f < 4000000) {
            sum += f;
    
            i += 3;
            f = fibonacci(i);
        }
    
        cout << "Answer: " << sum << endl;
